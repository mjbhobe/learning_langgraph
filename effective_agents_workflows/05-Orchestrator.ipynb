    "## Orchestrator\n",
    "In this workbook we'll build a workflow that illustrates _Orchestration_. This is an interesting worflow, where you want the LLM to break down a complex task into sub-tasks and then delegate each subtask to a separate _worker_ and then synthetize the result. This is kind of like parallelization, which we saw in [Parallelization](04-Parallelization.ipynb) notebook, except that the key difference is that you don't know each worker's assignment ahead of time. So you have the LLM reason about the task and then create a bunch of workers based upon its _reasoning_. So the LLM is _gating_ or creating the control workflow (rather than us using the `add_conditional_edges(...)` call.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this example we'll mimic deep research. The LLM will reason about the plan for a report and will dynamically generate a bunch of research sections and then goes about researching each section - classic example of an _Orchestrator-Worker_ type workflow."
